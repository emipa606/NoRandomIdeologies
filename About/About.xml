Do you have some good ideologies saved and wish that the other factions would use them instead of the some random ideology?

This mod will use your saved ideologies when other factions are generated and choose one if possible.
These will also be used when generating random wanderers and guests.
If no valid saved ideologies are found for a faction it will instead let the game generate one as normal.

You can also select preferred saved ideologies per faction in the mod-options. Due to how the ideologies are loaded you need an active game to do these faction settings. The values are saved globally however.

[b]NOTE: You may see warnings in your log when the mod caches the ideologies. For example if your saved ideology has a venerated animal from a mod that is currently not loaded, the game will throw an error when it tries to load it. 
These are expected and can be ignored, an ideology with references to not loaded mods will just be skipped.[/b]
